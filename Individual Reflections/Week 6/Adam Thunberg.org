* What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about how an experienced user/team of SCRUM works with user
stories and tasks.
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have worked professionally with problem solving in back-end web applications
and this experience is seemingly paying off when non-conventional programming
issues are presented. This is hopefully useful to members of the group that
haven't been working as much in the nitty gritty of code.
* What is my contribution towards the teams use of Scrum?
I helped pick the sprint theme and construct associated user stories. I assisted
in writing acceptance critera lists on each user story.
* What is my contribution towards the teams deliveries?
Unfortunately less than usual because of an exam this week-end. In short, I
developed a simple method to push multiple stacking warning/information dialog
windows that can be clicked away.
