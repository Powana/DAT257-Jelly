* What do I want to learn or understand better?
I wish to understand dynamic game object rendering and handling better in
Unity.
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since I've been struggling with Unity but finally came up with something, I
think my 2d tiling grid system can be of use when we start working on our
project which will likely use something very similar.
* What is my contribution towards the teams use of Scrum?
We haven't started using SCRUM yet, but I will make sure I have a decent
understanding of it before we do.
* What is my contribution towards the teams deliveries?
I have participated in the brainstorm of ideas for the project we had this week.
