* What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how best to organize data in classes in an engine like Unity.
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As I figure things out concerning storing resource data, I think it would be
helpful to share this knowledge.
* What is my contribution towards the teams use of Scrum?
I have assisted in the creation of our epics, user stories and issues/tasks.
* What is my contribution towards the teams deliveries?
I have completed a portion of the tasks, among other things the isometric
tilemap and it's accompanying script component with Martin. I have communicated
with Hussein about the zoom function and helped him fix the issue he
had. Finally, I helped Samuel get started with the shop and ability to purchase
cells.
