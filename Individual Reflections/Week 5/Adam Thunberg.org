* What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to understand technical debt better and how to work on reducing
it.
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I've developed many of the basics of resource management in the application as
it is and since it is relatively extensive I can hopefully help team members
complete related issues more effectively.
* What is my contribution towards the teams use of Scrum?
I helped pick the sprint theme and construct and refine user stories & tasks.
* What is my contribution towards the teams deliveries?
I developed methods and a new resource to handle workers on buildings. You can
now, in code, hire workers on cells and thus produce a certain fraction of the
potential production.

I also added "lake health" and implemented a reaction to high pollution where
lake health is depleted.
