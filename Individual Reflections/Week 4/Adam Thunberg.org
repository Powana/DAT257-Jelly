* What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to learn about game balancing and pacing since we face very related
challenges with the game we're developing.
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have racked up some hours on Stellaris, another "city" sim game, and perhaps
this knowledge could prove useful in the coming sprint where we actually might
consider how the different elements in the game should synergize.
* What is my contribution towards the teams use of Scrum?
I helped adjust and rework some of the epics along with the user stories. I
helped set up the theme of this weeks sprint and made some of the user stories.
* What is my contribution towards the teams deliveries?
I, along with Martin, made the ResourceManager class which holds all the global
resource related data. Additionally, I made the message window used for pop-up
messages for the player.
