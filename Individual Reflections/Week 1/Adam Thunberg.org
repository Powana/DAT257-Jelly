* What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to see SCRUM in action. Since I have no experience with it yet, it feels
like a black box to me.
Additionally, I seek experience with basic game development.
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
It's difficult to determine specifically what I can offer my team at the moment,
but I've completed a previous software project course previously and have some
practical experience in the workplace that can hopefully be of some use.
* What is my contribution towards the teams use of Scrum?
We haven't started using SCRUM yet, but I will make sure I have a decent
understanding of it before we do.
* What is my contribution towards the teams deliveries?
I have participated in the crafting of our initial social contract, the picking
of our KPI's and discussions and picking of project idea.
